- For the past 9 years I've been in leadership positions and part of growing a company from 5 to 100 employees.

- Since starting within IT in 2004 I've dealt mostly with games development and web, but I've figured that it does not matter what I do. The fun lies in the creation process.

- I have good understanding of the fundamentals of the modern software development setup including VCSs, package managers, artifact managers and registries, build systems etc.

- I like the overall DevOps concepts of value streams and finding good ways of visualizing and automating the regular flow of work.

- I enjoy fiddling with Node.js and trying to keep up in the fast-moving JavaScript community.

- I have spend a lots of time in a love/hate relationship with Jenkins and its myriad of plugins.

- I have a decent understanding of cloud. I've seen the light in the configuration tunnel (embraced IaC principles with Serverless Framework, CloudFormation templates, Ansible playbooks and more).

- "Defer commitment" is my favorite Lean principle. Architect your solution so that fewer commitments are irreversible. Defer commitment on irreversible decisions to the latest point possible.

- I believe that rules are meant to be ~~broken~~ understood and followed if and when they make sense and auto tested in any way possible.

- I prefer working with Unix-like operating systems. Linux for cloud, MacOS for front end.

- I've made countless poor decisions and solutions that did not survive the test of time.
